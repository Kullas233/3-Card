You’re up against the dealer in this quick and easy game of Tri Card Poker. Put down an Ante bet, and then start the action. You’ll get three cards face-up, and the dealer gets three cards face-down. If you think you’ve got what it takes to take down the dealer, raise the stakes with a second bet. If not, fold and start a new round. The dealer needs a Queen or higher to qualify, and you need a straight or better to earn an Ante bonus. Standard Ante and Raise wins are even-money.
